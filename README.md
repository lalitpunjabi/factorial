# Factorial Calculator (C++)
This is a simple C++ program that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. The program prompts the user to input a number and then outputs the factorial of that number.

Key Features:
Recursive Function: The program uses a recursive function (factorial) to compute the factorial of a given number.
User Input: It takes an integer input from the user, which is used to calculate the factorial.
Output: The factorial of the entered number is displayed as the result.
How It Works:
The program uses a base case of n <= 1, where the factorial of 0 or 1 is 1.
For any number greater than 1, the function calls itself with n - 1 and multiplies the result with n, calculating the factorial recursively.
